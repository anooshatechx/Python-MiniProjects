# Course 2 - Python Data Structures  

This folder contains three beginner-friendly Python projects I created while learning data structures.  
Each project focuses on strings, list, dictionaries, and applying logic to real-life problems.

## 📘 1. Contact Book  

A mini program that allows users to **store and manage contacts** easily.  
You can:  
- Add new contacts with names and phone numbers  
- Search for a saved contact by name  
- View all saved contacts in one place  
- Exit the program anytime  

**📝 What I learned:**  
- How to use **dictionaries** to store data as key-value pairs  
- Taking continuous input using a `while True` loop

## 🎯 2. Quiz Game  

A fun command-line quiz game that tests the player’s knowledge with **five multiple-choice questions**.  
It does:  
- Displays each question one by one  
- Takes the user’s answer and checks if it’s correct  
- Shows feedback (“Superb!” or the right answer if wrong)  
- Displays the final score out of 5 at the end  

**📝 What I learned:**   
- Comparing user input correctly even if the letter case is different  
- Managing the quiz flow using loops and conditions

## 🧮 3. Math Toolkit  

A simple toolkit that works like a **mini calculator**.  
You can do:  
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division  
- Square or Square Root of a number  

The program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.  

**📝 What I learned:**  
- How to handle multiple operations with `if-elif` statements  
- Preventing errors like dividing by zero

## 💡 Challenges I Faced  

Honestly, I didn’t face any major difficulties because I practiced every topic for an entire day before building these.  
The minor challenge I did face was mostly about:  
- Loop placement and indentation
