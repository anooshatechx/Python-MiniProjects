# Course 1 – Python Basics

This folder contains mini-projects I built while learning the fundamentals of Python.  
Each project focuses on core concepts like variables, input/output, loops, and conditionals.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Calculator  
- Performs basic arithmetic operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, **exponents**, **modulus**.  
- [Calculator](calculator.py)

**📝 What I learned:**  
- How to take user input and convert it to numbers.  
- Using conditionals (`if` / `elif` / `else`) to perform different operations.  
- Handling invalid choices with simple error checks.  

**⚡ What was difficult for me:**  
- Remembering when to use `elif` vs multiple `if` statements.  
- Making sure division worked correctly (e.g., dividing by zero issue).  

**✅ What I improved:**  
- Got comfortable with conditional chains.  
- Learned how to use `try/except` effectively.

### 2. Even-Odd Finder  
- Checks if a number is odd or even.  
- [Even-Odd Finder](even_odd_finder.py)

**📝 What I learned:**  
- Wrapping code in a loop so the program runs multiple times until the user quits.  

**⚡ What was difficult for me:**  
- Handling invalid input (letters, symbols) without crashing the program.  
- Deciding when to use `break` vs `continue`.  

**✅ What I improved:**  
- Made the program user-friendly with a repeat option.

### 3. Multiplication Table Generator  
- Generates the multiplication table of a number.  
- Can choose how far the table goes (e.g., up to 10, 20, etc.).  
- [Multiplication Table Generator](multiplication_table_generator.py)

**📝 What I learned:**  
- Defining and calling a function with parameters.  
- Looping through a range of numbers (`while`) and incrementing values.  

**⚡ What was difficult for me:**  
- At first, I returned values instead of printing inside the function, which stopped my loop from working correctly.  
- I also misplaced `num2 = num2 + 1` outside the loop, which caused an infinite loop.  

**✅ What I improved:**  
- Understood the difference between `print` and `return`.  
- Fixed my loop logic and indentation errors.  
- Gained confidence in defining and using functions.

### 4. Number Guessing Game  
- Guesses a random number until correct.  
- Practice with loops and conditions.  
- [Number Guessing Game](number_guessing_game.py)

**📝 What I learned:**  
- Using the `random` module to generate random numbers.  
- Combining loops (`while` + `for`) for repeated gameplay.  
- Using `break` to stop a loop early when a condition is met.  
- Handling invalid input with `try/except`.  
- Designing basic game logic with replay functionality.  

**⚡ What was difficult for me:**  
- This was the most overwhelming and challenging project I’ve built so far.  
- Took a lot of trials and errors and spent *2 whole hours* figuring it out.  
- Managing nested loops, break statements, and replay logic was tricky at first.  

**✅ What I improved:**  
- Gained confidence in using loops effectively.  
- Learned how to control the flow of a program with `break` and `while True`.  
- Understood how to combine multiple concepts (loops, conditionals, random numbers, error handling) in one project.
